# Objective
As an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do an exploratory data analysis of aviation dataset giving insights into average prices and duration between major flying cities in India. 

# Dataset
The source of this data is Kaggle and thus considered as secondary data. The dataset includes details on the ticket booking alternatives available through the website "Easemytrip" for flights between India's top 6 metro cities. 
Following are the key features of the dataset corresponding to `50 days of data from February 11 to March 31 of 2022`.
